Question 4: The code return an error! 'ReferenceError: result is not defined'. This is because the scope of the variable result, due to the 'let' keyword, it only within the code block from line 3 - line 11. Therefore, at line 13, no variable result exists.

Question 5: The code return an error! The code does not reach line 9, as it throws up an error on line 7. 'TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.'. This is because the const keyword prevents the variable from being reassigned after it is assigned for the first time.

Question 6: The code return an error! The code does not reach line 13, as it throws up an error on line 7. 'TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.'. This is because the const keyword prevents the variable from being reassigned after it is assigned for the first time.
