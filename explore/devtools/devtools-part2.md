Question 1: 

The bug was that the input of the numbers is taken in String format, and therefore for example '1' + '2' results in '12'. To fix this we need to either change the input format or convert our parameters to integer.

Question 2:

To fix this we need to either change the input format or convert our parameters to integer. I decided to multiply num1 and num2 by 1 individually, which let to their own type casting as a number. This led to the correct output. Screenshots included!
